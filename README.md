# Portforlio
# My profolio is a project to show how much I know so far in my second week of bootcamp
couple of things I did on this project:
<ul>
<li> Use extended CSS</li>
<li> Added images to my webpage</li>
<li> Added links to my previous projects, contact, Bio, location to the project</li>
<li> Kept it simple</li>
</ul> 

<p>some of the places I got inspiration fron was Angela Yu's course on Udemy and past recording of classes in zoom. </p>
